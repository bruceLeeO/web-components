	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>As a child I am very fascinated about how things work and how things are built.  I mostly enjoyed taking toys apart just so I can see and examine what is inside of it.  As an adult I have gone through many different fields of interest but there's always that fascination about building things: I have build libraries of human cDNA clones, turned an empty commercial building space into retail shops and restaurants, constructed residential homes from the ground up, and I even programmed a survey tool that marketing department from a previous job used to generate surveys for fans on the fly.  But my interest has shifted to the internet, seeing beautiful, highly functional website, I can see that there's lots of opportunity to build better and more efficient site, develop apps that people find easy to use, that is my current area of interest.  I aim to take the guess work out of any challenges so that you may relax and have fun (like the guy reading the papers in the picture floating in the dead sea above).</p>
